# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Computer Vision & Deep Learning
 
 **Overview:**
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a crucial component of modern intelligent transportation systems. This project presents an end-to-end ANPR pipeline that detects vehicle license plates from images, segments individual characters, and recognizes them using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The system combines traditional Computer Vision techniques for efficient plate localization with Deep Learning for robust character recognition, achieving high accuracy on Indian license plates.

**Problem Statement:**

Manual vehicle monitoring for:
- Traffic law enforcement
- Toll collection
- Parking management
- Security access control is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

Traffic cameras generate massive volumes of visual data, making manual review impractical. The challenge is to convert raw pixel data into structured, searchable license plate numbers automatically.

**Business Value:**

This ANPR system addresses real-world needs by enabling:
⚡ Faster Throughput – Automated toll and parking systems
🔐 Enhanced Security – Real-time identification of authorized / unauthorized vehicles
💰 Cost Reduction – Reduced manpower for 24×7 monitoring
📈 Scalability – Deployable on existing CCTV infrastructure

**System Architecture:**

The solution follows a modular pipeline:

License Plate Detection

Haar Cascade Classifier for fast and lightweight localization

Character Segmentation

Image preprocessing (Grayscale, Thresholding)

Contour detection and geometric filtering
